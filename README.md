# Hello-World repository	
## Test to see how GitHub works	
 In this repository you will only find Hello-World and test files. The main purpose for this repository is for me to play around with Git/GitHub, and see how it works.	
 Currently there should be an Hello World python file and C++ file
 
 Hey Lennart, ik ben aan het testen hoe die vorken hier werken.
